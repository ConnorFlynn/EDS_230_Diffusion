```{r}

initialC = 100 # initialC  initial concentration (mg/L)
dx = 10 # dx length of each segment (m)
nx = 10 # nx  number of discrete segments (m)
nt = 10 # nt  number of discrete time intervals (s)
dt = 10 # dt  seconds in each time interval (s)
area = 10 # area area of cross section of container (m2)
D = 1 # D  diffusivity (how easily the chemical diffuses (s/m2)

result = diff1(initialC = initialC, nt = nt, dt = dt, nx = nx, D = D, area = area, dx = dx)
filled.contour(result$conc, ylab="Distance", xlab="Time")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
